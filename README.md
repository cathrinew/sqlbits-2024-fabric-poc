## Session Description

**Build a Microsoft Fabric Proof of Concept in a Day**

Are you itching to get hands-on building solutions in Microsoft Fabric, but aren't quite sure where to start? Maybe you're coming from the world of Power BI and want to explore more of the tech behind the scenes? Or is it finally time to take-off and move away from the on-premises Microsoft BI stack to fully embrace the latest and greatest of analytical tools in the cloud? If so, this workshop is for you!

In just one day, you will learn everything you need to build a Microsoft Fabric Proof of Concept.

We will start with an overview of architectures and capabilities, then define the most important factors that will help you decide which parts of Fabric are appropriate for your project. Lakehouse or Warehouse? Pipelines or Notebooks? Eventstreams or Power Query? Microsoft Fabric can do it all! Once you have a plan and a few rough diagrams, it's time to dig into the details.

As we start looking at how to ingest, transform and store the data, you will be divided into boarding groups where everyone is working on similar proof of concepts using the same technologies. Each group will be led by a flight attendant who will guide and assist you during your flight. By teaming up, collaborating, and discussing with each other, you will also gain valuable insight and learn from each otherâ€™s experiences.

Once the data is ready for consumption, we will look at how to create beautiful visualizations and tell data stories using Power BI, how to empower business analysts by automating actions based on changing data, and how to roll out a fully governed solution in your organization.

Don't miss this opportunity to experience Microsoft Fabric's game-changing potential firsthand and learn how it can revolutionize your analytical workflow! Our experienced flight attendants will ensure a safe flight full of relevant use cases and a good learning environment.

Remember to put on your own Fabric mask before helping your clients or organization. Devices must be switched on for the entire duration of the flight. All snacks are complimentary. Ready for take-off?
