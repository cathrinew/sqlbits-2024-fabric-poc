## Welcome!

This page contains all files you will need in order to set up the data transformation of the AirBnB data we will use for this PoC. 
In addition to the notebook-files containing the data transformation, I have also added some screen shots of how I have created the different pipelines to run the notebooks and essentially the transformation of data between the different layers. 

## Notebook files: 



## Pipelin configuration:
